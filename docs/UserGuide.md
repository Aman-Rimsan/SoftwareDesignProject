## Program Description
The program involves developing an inventory tracking system tailored for a tech company. It will include login/logout functionality, enabling users to view stored raw or sorted data and interact with the inventory by editing, deleting, adding, and viewing products. The system will not involve purchasing but will provide essential features for employees and administrators.
