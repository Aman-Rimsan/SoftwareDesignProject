## Overall
Documentation detailing aspects of the program, the goal is to use this plan to organize thoughts and build a strong developer and user guide


## Developer Guide
* Will be placed within a "doc" file in the repository while being labeled "DevGuide.md"
* Contents will be split into subcategories, with each section explaining a different part of the codebase and the logic behind it  
* Will cover setup instructions, file roles (e.g., `Stock.py`, `UI.py`, `unit.py`), and how different components interact  
* Will include testing and build instructions to help onboard new developers and simplify future debugging
* Build and Test process's will be documented within this, as the info will be highly relevant for developers
* We'll add our diagrams to help developers, especially new ones develop a better understanding of the functionality

* Designed to be simple and visual â€” will include screenshots of the UI with labeled steps to guide the user  
* Each function (Add Product, Edit Product, Search, etc.) will be documented with brief explanations and sample usage  
* Will clarify any vague or confusing areas using step-by-step examples
* Other diagrams may be added if any concepts need further understanding
