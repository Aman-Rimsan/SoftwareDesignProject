## Software Notes
The customer requires a software system designed for internal use by a tech company. The software will read a large file containing information about the inventory of the customer's computer stocks, price, name, etc. It will then count the number of each product in stock and sort it. The customer has decided to allow us to determine how to sort the products. The system will allow admins to search, add, edit, remove, and sort products. While employees can only view, sort, and search for products. This software will not be designed for use by customers, it is a company-only software used for inventory tracking. The UI of the software will be completely determined by the development team as the customer has no preferences.
