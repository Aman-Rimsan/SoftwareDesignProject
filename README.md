# SoftwareDesignProject

## Project description
The project involves developing an inventory tracking system tailored for a tech company. It will include login/logout functionality, enabling users to view stored raw or sorted data and interact with the inventory by editing, deleting, adding, and viewing products. The system will not involve purchasing but will provide essential features for employees and administrators.

## Roles 
Project Manager: Abbas Akbar

Technical Manager: Amanulla Mohammed Rimsan

Front-End Lead: Lesley Ozurigbo

Back-End Lead: Abdul Ghafour Ahmed

Software Quality Lead: Ze Yu Shi

Developers: All

## Software Notes
The customer requires a software system designed for internal use by a tech company. The software will read a large file containing information about the inventory of the customer's computer stocks, price, name, etc. It will then count the number of each product in stock and sort it. The customer has decided to allow us to determine how to sort the products. The system will allow admins to search, add, edit, remove, and sort products. While employees can only view, sort, and search for products. This software will not be designed for use by customers, it is a company-only software used for inventory tracking. The UI of the software will be completely determined by the development team as the customer has no preferences
